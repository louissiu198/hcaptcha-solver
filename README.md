# Hcaptcha Solver
## Released in 250 Stars 
I'm not a guy that doesn't follow the instruction and wouldn't add stars when it reached
If it reached to 100 stars I would definitely release (But no bots please)
## Early Release (PAID)
300 Usd For Source Code (5 folders, 4 main files, 2 trained image model and text model)
150 Usd For API Access (lifetime, have updates if patched or flagged)
100 Usd For Lifetime Exe (flask server, local api server, if it breaks no updates)
If you can't wait that long, DM louissiu#1998 to purchase
## Reason I want to release
Xtekky released his captcha solver online, but I have some comments for it, the motiondata wasn't spoofed enough, and the (getcaptcha) and (checkcaptcha) has different format of motiondata, not the same. Also as the apiKey of openai has a limit usage so it wasn't a good idea (even poe.com because they updated a lot so there's little chance only using them) that's why I'm trying to release, but if I released too early, skids gonna go and **RESELL IT** and I hope this won't happen
